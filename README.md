# Important Notes 

### The project uses SQLite as its database and has initial data inside it, so no additional setup is required for the database. 
### But if you want to use another database from scratch, Just change the connection string in appsettings.json and make other settings in Program.cs 
### There is a Data Seeder class in program.cs as you will see and it will automatically seed the data to the DB just for the first time you run the project.
